##About the Project

Index.html is a landing page to explain the site, and how it all works. From there the user can continue on to either create their garage or view other people's lists.

#### Create Your Garage

On the create page the user can put in some information about themselves and create their garage.

They can then add 5 cars to the garage and as long as the total cost is under $1M the garage can be saved and posted. The cars are added by entering the year make model and cost.

#### Viewing Other Garages

The user can view a list of other garages with the user info shown along side.
